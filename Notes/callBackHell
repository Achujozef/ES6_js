Callback hell, also known as the "Pyramid of Doom," refers to a situation in asynchronous JavaScript programming where multiple nested callbacks are used, making the code complex, hard to read, and challenging to maintain. It often occurs when dealing with asynchronous operations like fetching data, handling events, or making API calls. The deeply nested structure can lead to code that is difficult to follow, error-prone, and challenging to debug. To mitigate callback hell, modern JavaScript development utilizes techniques like Promises, async/await syntax, and modularization to create more readable and manageable asynchronous code.
