* Undefined:
In JavaScript, "undefined" is a special value that a variable can hold. If a variable is declared but has not been assigned a value, it will have the value of "undefined". It can also represent the return value of a function that doesn't explicitly return anything.

* Not Defined:
"Not defined" refers to a situation where an identifier (variable, function, etc.) has not been declared or is not in scope. Attempting to use an identifier that is not defined will result in a ReferenceError.
