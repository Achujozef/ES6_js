Scope chain refers to the hierarchical structure in JavaScript where variables are looked up and accessed. When a variable is accessed, the interpreter searches through the chain of nested scopes, starting from the innermost and moving outward, until it finds the variable or reaches the global scope. This mechanism allows functions to access variables defined in their parent or ancestor scopes. If a variable is not found anywhere in the scope chain, a ReferenceError occurs. Understanding the scope chain is crucial for correctly managing variable visibility and avoiding naming conflicts in JavaScript programs.
