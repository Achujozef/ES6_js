Promises are a fundamental concept in asynchronous JavaScript programming, introduced to handle and improve the readability of asynchronous operations. A promise represents a value that might be available now, in the future, or never. It helps manage the complexity of asynchronous code and makes it more structured.

A promise has three states:

* Pending: The initial state, representing an ongoing asynchronous operation.
* Fulfilled: The operation completed successfully, and the promise has a resulting value.
* Rejected: The operation failed, and the promise holds a reason for the failure.
Promises enable you to chain asynchronous operations and handle success and error cases separately, enhancing code readability. The introduction of promises paved the way for the async/await syntax, which further simplifies writing and understanding asynchronous code in a more synchronous-like manner.
